- What does static mean?
- Static instance variables
- Static methods

### What does static mean?
- Think of static as belonging to the class and not to the individual instances of class.
- A static method means the method exists at the class level and is not specific to the instance.
- The one static method that you have in a lot of your classes is **main**.
- Used when you do not need an instance of the object.
- **Math.sqrt** is a method that computes the square root of a number. You do not need an instance of mathematics before you know how to compute the square root.
- classname.method

### Using static methods
- To use a static method called method1 in a class called Class1 the code is Class1.method1(parameters...)
- You do not have to create an instance of the class in order to invoke the method
- Many java utility functions are static methods. Almost all math function are static methods in the **Math** class.

### Static versus non-static
- Consider the Rational number class
- To reduce 2/4 to 1/2 a common thing to do is to compute the greatest common divisor. To compute the gcd you do not need an instance of a fraction.

### Static instance variables
- Static instance variables are used if you want some information to be shared by **every instance of a class**.
- A common use case is constants
- For constants you also get to see the keyword **final**. Final meaning you do not get to override this value in any manner.
- **Python neither constant nor final are existed in python**. We can create a constant class to minic constant class that similar to Java.
- In Python, it doesnâ€™t require a static keyword. All variables which are assigned a value in class declaration are static class variables. And variables which are assigned values inside methods are instance variables.
